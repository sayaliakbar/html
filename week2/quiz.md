## Answers

1. B) href
2. C) `<a href="url" target="_blank">`
3. B) alt
4. C) JPEG
5. A) `<dl>`
6. B) start="5"

9. A) `<map>`
10. D) x
11. False
12. True
13. False
14. True
15. True
16. The `alt` attribute provides text alternatives for images, helping with accessibility for screen readers and displaying text if the image fails to load.
17. The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document. Values include: `_blank` (opens in new tab/window), `_self` (opens in same frame), `_parent` (opens in parent frame), `_top` (opens in full body of window).
18. An unordered list (`<ul>`) presents items in no particular order with bullet points and is used for groups of items where order doesn't matter. A definition list (`<dl>`) pairs terms (`<dt>`) with their definitions (`<dd>`) and is used for glossaries, metadata, or any name-value pairs.
19. An image map is an image with clickable areas that act as links. Use cases include: interactive maps where different regions link to different pages, product diagrams where clicking different parts shows information about those components, or floor plans where different rooms link to detailed information.
20. The semantic table structure includes `<thead>` for header rows, `<tbody>` for main content rows, and `<tfoot>` for footer rows. This structure improves accessibility, allows for separate styling of different table sections, and helps browsers render tables more efficiently, especially for large tables where the body might scroll while headers remain visible.
