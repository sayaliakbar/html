# Week 2 Project: Navigation Page

## Project Overview

For your Week 2 project, you will create a navigation page that demonstrates your mastery of links, images, lists, and tables. This page will serve as a central hub linking to various pages of a website.

## Requirements

1. **Home Page Structure**

   - Create a main index.html file with proper HTML structure
   - Include appropriate meta tags in the head
   - Implement a header, main content area, and footer

2. **Navigation Menu**

   - Create a primary navigation menu with at least 5 links
   - Include both text links and at least one image-based link
   - Implement a secondary navigation menu in the footer

3. **Content Sections**

   - Implement at least 3 content sections with headings
   - Use lists (ordered, unordered, and definition) to organize information
   - Include internal page links (anchors) to jump between sections

4. **Media Integration**

   - Include at least 3 images with appropriate alt text and size attributes
   - Create a simple image map for one of your images
   - Add figure captions for images where appropriate

5. **Data Table**

   - Create a table displaying information relevant to your site theme
   - Implement proper table structure with thead, tbody, and tfoot
   - Use colspan or rowspan to create a more complex table structure

6. **Advanced Features**
   - Add mailto and tel links in the contact section
   - Implement a download link for a (sample) document
   - Use proper semantic HTML throughout the document

## Design Guidelines

- Focus on structure and organization rather than styling (we'll cover CSS later)
- Ensure all links have descriptive text
- Make sure the page is logically organized and easy to navigate
- Include comments in your HTML to explain your structural choices

## Submission

Your final submission should include:

1. index.html (main page)
2. Any additional HTML files linked from the main page
3. An images folder containing all images used
4. Any sample documents for download links

## Grading Criteria

- Correct HTML structure and syntax (25%)
- Proper implementation of links, images, and image maps (25%)
- Effective use of lists and tables to organize content (25%)
- Navigation structure and overall usability (15%)
- Code organization and comments (10%)

## Example
