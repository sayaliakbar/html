# Week 2 Project: Navigation Page

## Project Overview

For this week's project, you will create a multi-page website with a navigation system. This will demonstrate your understanding of links, images, lists, and basic page structure.

## Requirements

Your navigation page project should include:

1. **A Home Page (index.html)** with:

   - Clear site title and welcome message
   - Navigation menu using an unordered list
   - At least one relevant image with proper alt text
   - Brief introduction to the website's purpose

2. **At least 3 Content Pages** on topics of your choice, each containing:

   - Proper HTML structure
   - Consistent navigation menu
   - At least one image related to the page topic
   - Content organized with headings and paragraphs
   - At least one list (ordered or unordered)

3. **A Contact Page** with:

   - Email link
   - Phone link (fictional is fine)
   - Contact form layout (non-functional, just the structure)
   - Address information

4. **A simple data table** on at least one page displaying relevant information

## Implementation Requirements

1. **File Structure**

   - Create a folder named `navigation-project`
   - All project files should be inside this folder
   - Name your home page `index.html`
   - Use descriptive names for other HTML files

2. **Navigation**

   - Each page should include the same navigation menu
   - Navigation should use an unordered list inside a `<nav>` element
   - Links should correctly connect all pages
   - Include a "you are here" indicator (e.g., bold or different style) for the current page

3. **Images**

   - Include at least one image per page
   - All images must have appropriate `alt` text
   - Consider using both absolute and relative image links

4. **Lists and Tables**

   - Implement at least one ordered and one unordered list
   - Create a data table with proper structure including `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and semantic headers

5. **Links**
   - Include internal links between pages
   - Add at least one external link that opens in a new tab
   - Include bookmark links on at least one page with long content
   - Add email and phone contact links

## Example Site Ideas

- A personal hobby or interest site
- A travel destination guide
- A product or service showcase
- A tutorial or how-to guide
- A fan page for a movie, book, or band
