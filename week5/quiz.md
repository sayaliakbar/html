13. `<article>` represents a self-contained composition that could stand alone (blog post, news story, product card). `<section>` represents a thematic grouping of content that typically has a heading and is part of a larger whole. Use `<article>` for independent content, `<section>` for grouping related content.
14. Benefits include: improved accessibility for screen readers, better SEO as search engines understand content structure, clearer code organization, more consistent document structure, future-proofing for web technologies, and better browser reader modes.
15. Document outline is formed by combining heading levels with sectioning elements. Each sectioning element (`<article>`, `<section>`, etc.) can have its own heading hierarchy starting with an `<h1>`. The heading level creates a hierarchy within its section, and sectioning elements create logical divisions of content.
