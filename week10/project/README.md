# Week 10 Project: Interactive Product Showcase

## Project Overview

For this week's project, you will create an interactive product showcase that demonstrates your mastery of advanced HTML features. The showcase will allow users to explore different products, drag and drop items into a shopping cart, filter products by attributes, and interact with custom UI components.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Implement drag and drop functionality for intuitive user interactions
- Create and use custom web components for reusable UI elements
- Utilize custom data attributes to manage product information and state
- Apply advanced CSS attribute selectors for dynamic styling
- Build an interactive shopping experience with client-side features

## Project Requirements

### Basic Requirements (All students must complete)

1. **Product Showcase Layout**

   - Create a responsive layout with a product grid, filter sidebar, and shopping cart area
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements appropriately
   - Design a clean, accessible, and user-friendly interface

2. **Drag and Drop Shopping Cart**

4. **Product Filtering System**

   - Store product attributes (category, price, rating, etc.) using data attributes
   - Implement filters that allow users to narrow down products by these attributes
   - Create a tag system for product features
   - Apply filters instantly without page reload

5. **Interactive Product Details**
   - Show additional information when users click or hover on products
   - Use custom tooltips for displaying feature details

   - Allow users to adjust quantities of items in the cart
   - Implement the ability to save cart contents using localStorage
   - Calculate shipping based on item weight or other attributes
   - Add a checkout flow with form validation

7. **Custom Tabs and Modal Component**

   - Create a tabbed interface for product descriptions, specifications, and reviews
   - Implement a custom modal component for quick product views
   - Ensure keyboard accessibility for all components
   - Use custom events for component communication

8. **Animation and Transitions**

   - Add smooth animations when filtering products
   - Create transition effects when adding items to cart
   - Implement progressive loading animations
