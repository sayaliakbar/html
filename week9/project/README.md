# Week 9 Project: Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview

For this week's project, you will create an interactive dashboard that utilizes the advanced HTML5 features we've covered: Canvas for data visualization, SVG for UI elements, Web Storage for saving user preferences, and the Geolocation API for location-aware functionality.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Implement interactive data visualizations using Canvas
- Create responsive vector graphics with SVG
- Store and retrieve user data using Web Storage APIs
- Use the Geolocation API to enhance user experience
- Combine multiple HTML5 technologies in a cohesive application

## Project Requirements

### Basic Requirements (All students must complete)

1. **Dashboard Layout**

   - Create a responsive dashboard layout with at least 3 "widget" areas
   - Include a header with the dashboard title and a settings button
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements appropriately

2. **Canvas Chart Widget**

   - Create at least one data visualization using Canvas
   - Implement a bar chart, line chart, or pie chart
   - Include interactivity (hover effects, tooltips, etc.)
   - Use sample data (provided below or create your own)

3. **SVG Icon System**

   - Create an SVG icon system for your dashboard
   - Include at least 5 different icons (settings, user, chart types, etc.)
   - Make the icons responsive and accessible
   - Use proper SVG attributes and techniques

4. **User Preferences**

   - Implement a settings panel that allows users to customize the dashboard
   - Save user preferences (theme color, layout options, etc.) using localStorage
   - Apply saved preferences when the page loads
   - Include a "reset to defaults" option

5. **Weather Widget**
   - Create a weather widget that uses the Geolocation API
   - Display the current location of the user
   - Include appropriate error handling for denied permissions
   - Provide a fallback for when geolocation is unavailable

### Advanced Requirements (For additional challenge)

6. **Multiple Chart Types**

   - Implement 3+ types of charts/visualizations
   - Allow users to switch between different chart types
   - Animate transitions between chart types

7. **Draggable Widgets**

   - Make dashboard widgets draggable
   - Save widget positions using localStorage
   - Restore the layout when the page is revisited

8. **Real-time Updates**

   - Simulate real-time data updates for your visualizations
   - Implement smooth animations for data changes
   - Allow users to pause/resume updates

9. **Location-Based Features**
   - Implement distance calculations
   - Show nearby points of interest based on user location
   - Use continuous location tracking (if appropriate)
