13. The `<button>` element can contain HTML content (text and other elements) while `<input type="submit">` can only display plain text via its value attribute. Both can submit forms, but `<button>` is more flexible for styling and content.
14. Labels associate descriptive text with form controls, making forms more accessible to screen readers. They also provide a larger clickable area for the control, making it easier for users to interact with small controls like radio buttons and checkboxes.
15. The `placeholder` attribute provides a hint to the user about what kind of information is expected in the field, which disappears when the user starts typing. The `value` attribute sets the default value that appears in the field and will be submitted with the form if not changed.
