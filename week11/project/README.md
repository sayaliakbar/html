# Week 11 Project: Accessible Website Audit & Improvement

## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply your knowledge of web accessibility by auditing an existing website and making improvements to ensure it meets accessibility standards. This project simulates a real-world scenario where you need to evaluate and enhance the accessibility of a website that was built without proper accessibility considerations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Evaluate a website for accessibility issues
- Apply WCAG guidelines to identify and solve accessibility problems
- Implement semantic HTML to improve structure and meaning
- Apply proper ARIA attributes where native HTML is insufficient
- Enhance keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Ensure proper color contrast and visual accessibility
- Document accessibility improvements and their impact

## Project Requirements

### Part 1: Accessibility Audit (30%)

1. **Audit the Provided Website**

   - Conduct a thorough accessibility audit of the provided website
   - Use both automated tools (WAVE, Lighthouse, axe) and manual testing
   - Document all accessibility issues found, categorizing them by severity and type

2. **Create an Audit Report**
   - Prepare a detailed report that includes:
     - List of all identified issues
     - References to relevant WCAG success criteria for each issue
     - Screenshots or code examples demonstrating the problems
     - Recommendations for fixing each issue
     - Prioritization of issues based on severity and impact

### Part 2: Implementation of Fixes (50%)

3. **Apply Semantic HTML Improvements**

   - Replace non-semantic elements with appropriate semantic alternatives
   - Implement proper heading structure (h1-h6)
   - Ensure proper use of landmarks and sectioning elements
   - Add descriptive alt text to all images

4. **Keyboard Accessibility Improvements**

   - Make all interactive elements keyboard-accessible
   - Add visible focus indicators
   - Implement proper tab order
   - Add skip links as needed

5. **Screen Reader Optimizations**

   - Add ARIA attributes where needed
   - Fix form label associations
   - Create meaningful link text
   - Add descriptions for complex elements

6. **Visual Design Improvements**
   - Fix color contrast issues
   - Ensure information is not conveyed by color alone
   - Implement responsive design elements that work at 200% zoom
   - Add visible focus states

### Part 3: Documentation and Reflection (20%)

7. **Documentation of Changes**

   - Create a comprehensive document outlining:
     - Before and after comparisons for key issues
     - Explanation of the accessibility improvements made
     - Code snippets showing key changes
     - Screenshots demonstrating visual changes

8. **Reflection and Testing**
   - Test the improved website with:
     - Keyboard-only navigation
     - Screen reader testing
     - Browser zoom testing (up to 200%)
     - Mobile device testing
   - Write a reflection on what you learned and challenges you faced

## Project Resources

### Sample Website

You will be provided with a sample website that has various accessibility issues. The website is a fictional e-commerce platform named "TechTrends" that sells gadgets and electronics. You can either work on this provided website or choose one of the following options:

1. Audit and improve one of your previous projects
2. Audit and improve a personal website or blog
3. Get instructor approval for a different website to audit

### Requirements for the Final Submission

Your final submission should include:

1. **Accessibility Audit Report** (PDF format)
2. **Original Website Files** (before modifications)
3. **Improved Website Files** (after implementing fixes)
4. **Documentation of Changes** (PDF format)
5. **Reflection Summary** (300-500 words)
